(Hopefully) useful scripts for geospatial data management and analysis.

Languages: R and Python

More coming soon ;)

Attention:
Some scripts are still "Dummy scripts", which means that they have to be adjusted, e.g. by using correct filenames, output formats and so on! They will be re-written to fully functional modules when there is some spare time ;)
