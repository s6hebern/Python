Basically my personal backup of scripts for geospatial data management and analysis, but free to everybody whom it might concern. 

Languages: R and Python

Some might be outdated, bad style or of relevance only to me, but I'm working on it... more coming soon ;-)

Feel free to contact me for suggestions or comments.
