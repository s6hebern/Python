    Create an image containing a basic statistical value from a multiband-image.
    
    
    Use:
    
    infile (string): the (multiband) input image (full path and file extension).
    
    outfile (string): the output image (full path and file extension).
    
    mode (string / list): the desired statistical value(s). If a string is
            given, the output image will contain one band with the specified 
            value. If a list of strings is given, one band will be created for 
            each list element (in the same order).
            
            mode can be chosen from the following numpy functions:
                    - mean

                    - min

            GDAL raster formats (see: http://www.gdal.org/formats_list.html).

    co (list): a list of strings, containing advanced raster creation 
            options such as band interleave.
